# Breadth-First-Search-Puzzle-Solver
•	Designed and implemented a puzzle solver in Java, employing the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to determine optimal solutions.

•	Leveraged strong algorithmic skills to implement the breadth-first-search algorithm in Java, determining the least number of moves required for optimal puzzle solutions.

•	Implemented both plain-text and Graphical UI versions in Java, providing users with intuitive interfaces to interact with puzzles and observe solutions.

•	Achieved efficient codebase management by utilizing the MVC design pattern, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
